			The morning of the 7th of June 2014 I&#39;ve received a call and someone identified himself as part of a company called Loto24 that were offering big opportunities for gambling with the Bonoloto services. I don&#39;t gamble 
and don&#39;t enjoy doing it and when someone calls me with offers like this my usual answer is &quot;just delete me from your phone database and bye&quot;. However the man started speaking before me so for some reason I decided to 
listen for a minute (Well done man, it is not easy to get to this point with me...). He asked me about what was the actual slogan of Bonoloto and he gave me three options. I had no idea so for ending the conversation I 
picked the one I thought it was less probable to be which as the man said turned to be correct (Maybe he said yes even it was no or even the three of them were right, I just can&#39;t tell...). After congratulating me he 
started to talk about his offer (while I searched in the internet for more information)...

I found hackthissite.org quite long time ago when I was learning some basics of computer security and I really liked it. It is meant to reinforce theoretical knowledge with some 
practice. It consists on a bunch of challenges that should be solved progressively.

Here I will try to explain some of the solutions I gave to the challenges for fun. My aim is to share the thoughts that lead me to the result as well as hearing your opinion about my procedures.

I never liked HTML or CSS too much. I have to say that althought they were easy for me to get started with them, I always found tricky to get some things well done. I have to say that HTML 5 standard did improve a lot 
of aspects of this language but I see this technology too far from where it should be. Althought it has evolved there has been no interest in fixing some of the most basic issues of the standard among, in some cases, 
no interest in site maintenance to keep up to date with the latest changes. I&#39;m thinking in an example while I write my opinion, it is translations.

			When trying to find exploits or vulnerabilities in embedded devices, any information is very useful.

Firmware analysis can be a good starting point as there&#39;s no need to have physical access to a device in order to investigate and there&#39;s no need to buy one as long as the manufacturer let you download updates from their website.

In the following examples I&#39;m going to use a firmware from TP-LINK for TL-WR841N v8 (Soft. version: 3.13.33).

Some time ago I bought an Alienware M14xR2 as my last laptop broke down. Lately, Alienware published an update for my BIOS that I can&#39;t burn in my computer because I only use Archlinux. By googling a bit I quickly 
found a tool for burning the BIOS in a DOS command line but I would need to have a look to the update package.

Last summer I&#39;ve been playing with an old access point I found among my unused devices. Although this is far away from being a top selling device I decided to investigate a bit in order to find security flaws on it.
